# Git Reset Hard

The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/ecommerce` present on Storage server in Stratos DC. This was just a test repository and one of the developers just pushed a couple of changes for testing, but now they want to clean this repository along with the commit history/work tree, so they want to point back the HEAD and the branch itself to a commit with message `add data.txt file`. Find below more details:

- In `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/ecommerce` git repository, reset the git commit history so that there are only two commits in the commit history i.e initial commit and add data.txt file.

- Also make sure to push your changes.

## Steps

1. Log into storage server and move into repository

    ```sh
    sudo -i
    cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/ecommerce
    ```

2. Let's check commits history

    ```sh
    git log --oneline
    ```

    ```shell
    [root@ststor01 ecommerce]# git log --oneline
    81e08fc (HEAD -> master, origin/master) Test Commit10
    686cb01 Test Commit9
    f0ff119 Test Commit8
    a8404ed Test Commit7
    a9fccf0 Test Commit6
    2554746 Test Commit5
    461c467 Test Commit4
    287d981 Test Commit3
    a63283d Test Commit2
    5479bcb Test Commit1
    90b2925 add data.txt file
    848a423 initial commit
    ```

3. Let's reset the commit history to old one

    ```ssh
    git reset --hard 90b2925
    ```

    ```shell
    root@ststor01 ecommerce]# git status
    On branch master
    Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 10 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
    (use "git pull" to update your local branch)

    nothing to commit, working tree clean
    ```

4. Push the changes

    ```sh
    git push --force
    ```
