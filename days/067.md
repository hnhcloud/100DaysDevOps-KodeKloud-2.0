# Deploy Guest Book App on Kubernetes

The Nautilus Application development team has finished development of one of the applications and it is ready for deployment. It is a guestbook application that will be used to manage entries for guests/visitors. As per discussion with the DevOps team, they have finalized the infrastructure that will be deployed on Kubernetes cluster. Below you can find more details about it.

## BACKEND TIER

Create a deployment named `redis-master` for Redis master.

a. Replicas count should be `1`.

b. Container name should be `master-redis-devops` and it should use image `redis`.

c. Request resources as CPU should be `100m` and Memory should be `100Mi`.

d. Container port should be redis default port i.e `6379`.

Create a service named `redis-master` for Redis master. Port and targetPort should be Redis default port i.e `6379`.

Create another deployment named `redis-slave` for Redis slave.

a. Replicas count should be `2`.

b. Container name should be `slave-redis-devops` and it should use `gcr.io/google_samples/gb-redisslave:v3` image.

c. Requests resources as CPU should be `100m` and Memory should be `100Mi`.

d. Define an environment variable named `GET_HOSTS_FROM` and its value should be `dns`.

e. Container port should be Redis default port i.e `6379`.

Create another service named `redis-slave`. It should use Redis default port i.e `6379`.

## FRONTEND TIER

Create a deployment named `frontend`.

a. Replicas count should be `3`.

b. Container name should be `php-redis-devops` and it should use `gcr.io/google-samples/gb-frontend@sha256:a908df8486ff66f2c4daa0d3d8a2fa09846a1fc8efd65649c0109695c7c5cbff` image.

c. Request resources as CPU should be `100m` and Memory should be `100Mi`.

d. Define an environment variable named as `GET_HOSTS_FROM` and its value should be `dns`.

e. Container port should be `80`.

Create a service named `frontend`. Its type should be `NodePort`, port should be `80` and its nodePort should be `30009`.

Finally, you can check the guestbook app by clicking on App button.

You can use any labels as per your choice.

> Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

## Steps

Let's summerize, we have to create?

- redis master and slave deployment as backend and php-redis deployment as frontend
- two services for redis master and slave and one service for frontend

1. Let's create `k3s-redis-master.yaml` file and copy-paste contents from this [Redis Master YAML file](../files/k3s-redis-master-deployment-067.yaml)

2. Let's create `k3s-redis-slave.yaml` file and copy-paste contents from this [Redis Salve YAML file](../files/k3s-redis-slave-deployment-067.yaml)

3. Let's create `k3s-php-redis.yaml` file and copy-paste contents from this [Php Redis YAML file](../files/k3s-php-redis-deployment-067.yaml)

4. Create all the deployment one by one

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f k3s-redis-master.yaml
    ```

    > wait few seconds until pods are running

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f k3s-redis-slave.yaml
    ```

    > wait few seconds until pods are running

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f k3s-php-redis.yaml
    ```

    > wait few seconds until all the pods are running

5. Verify results

    Access the application from the UI button.
