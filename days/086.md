# Ansible Ping Module Usage

The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to test several Ansible playbooks on different app servers in Stratos DC. Before that, some pre-requisites must be met. Essentially, the team needs to set up a password-less SSH connection between Ansible controller and Ansible managed nodes. One of the tickets is assigned to you; please complete the task as per details mentioned below:

a. Jump host is our Ansible controller, and we are going to run Ansible playbooks through thor user from jump host.

b. There is an inventory file `/home/thor/ansible/inventory` on jump host. Using that inventory file test Ansible ping from jump host to App Server 3, make sure ping works.

## Steps

1. Update the inventory file with specific user:

    ```ini
    stapp01 ansible_host=172.16.238.10 ansible_user=tony ansible_ssh_pass=Ir0nM@n
    stapp02 ansible_host=172.16.238.11 ansible_user=steve ansible_ssh_pass=Am3ric@
    stapp03 ansible_host=172.16.238.12 ansible_user=banner ansible_ssh_pass=BigGr33n

    [all:vars]
    ansible_ssh_common_args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
    ```

2. Test ping module
    - To ping all servers:

        ```sh
        ansible all -i inventory -m ping
        ```

    - To ping specific server:

        ```sh
        ansible stapp03 -i inventory -m ping
        ```
