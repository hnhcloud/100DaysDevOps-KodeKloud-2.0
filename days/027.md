# Git Revert Some Changes

The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo present on Storage server in Stratos DC. However, they reported an issue with the recent commits being pushed to this repo. They have asked the DevOps team to revert repo HEAD to last commit. Below are more details about the task:

- In /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo git repository, revert the latest commit ( HEAD ) to the previous commit (JFYI the previous commit hash should be with initial commit message ).
- Use revert demo message (please use all small letters for commit message) for the new revert commit.

## Steps

1. Login into storage server
2. Move into repository directory

    ```sh
    sudo su
    cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo
    ```

3. Check git log to find initial commit

    ```sh
    git log
    ```

    > if you find initial commit message, then copy commit hash and run the following command

    ```sh
    git reset --hard 5ab78e06c77c63aa0a8c0b54bef8df8e2ea164de
    ```

4. Push the changes

    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "revert demo"
    git push --force
    ```
