# Git Revert Some Changes

The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo present on Storage server in Stratos DC. However, they reported an issue with the recent commits being pushed to this repo. They have asked the DevOps team to revert repo HEAD to last commit. Below are more details about the task:

- In /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo git repository, revert the latest commit ( HEAD ) to the previous commit (JFYI the previous commit hash should be with initial commit message ).
- Use revert demo message (please use all small letters for commit message) for the new revert commit.

## Steps

1. Login into storage server
2. Move into repository directory

    ```sh
    sudo su
    cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo
    ```

3. Check git log to find initial commit

    ```sh
    git log --oneline
    ```

    > if you find initial commit message, then copy commit hash and run the following command

    ```sh
    git revert HEAD -m "revert demo"
    ```

4. Push the changes

    ```sh
    git push
    ```

## Good to Know?

### Git Revert vs Reset

- **Revert**: Creates new commit that undoes changes (safe)
- **Reset**: Moves HEAD pointer, can lose history (destructive)
- **Public History**: Use revert for shared repositories
- **Private History**: Reset acceptable for local changes

### Revert Operations

- **Single Commit**: `git revert commit-hash`
- **HEAD**: `git revert HEAD` - Revert latest commit
- **Range**: `git revert HEAD~3..HEAD` - Revert multiple commits
- **No Commit**: `git revert --no-commit` - Stage changes without committing

### Commit Messages

- **Descriptive**: Explain what is being reverted and why
- **Reference**: Include original commit hash or message
- **Convention**: Follow team's commit message standards
- **Traceability**: Help future developers understand changes

### Safety Considerations

- **Shared Repositories**: Always use revert, never reset
- **Testing**: Test reverted code before pushing
- **Communication**: Inform team about reverted changes
- **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
