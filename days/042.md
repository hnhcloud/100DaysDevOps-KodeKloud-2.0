# Create Docker Network

The Nautilus DevOps team needs to set up several docker environments for different applications. One of the team members has been assigned a ticket where he has been asked to create some docker networks to be used later. Complete the task based on the following ticket description:

- Create a docker network named as `blog` on App Server 2 in Stratos DC.
- Configure it to use `macvlan` drivers.
- Set it to use subnet `10.10.1.0/24` and iprange `10.10.1.0/24`.

## Steps

Login into app server 2 and run the following command:

```sh
docker network create blog -d macvlan --ip-range 10.10.1.0/24 --subnet 10.10.1.0/24
```

To verify run the following command:

```sh
docker network ls
```

If you need to understand more on `docker network` command, you can use `help`:

```sh
docker network --help
```
