# Git Branch Create

Nautilus developers are actively working on one of the project repositories, `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/media`. Recently, they decided to implement some new features in the application, and they want to maintain those new changes in a separate branch. Below are the requirements that have been shared with the DevOps team:

- On Storage server in Stratos DC create a new branch `xfusioncorp_media` from master branch in `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/media` git repo.

- Please do not try to make any changes in the code.

## Steps

1. Login into storage server and run the following commands:

    ```sh
    sudo su
    cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/media
    ```

2. Let's check current branch

    ```sh
    git branch
    ```

    if current branch is n't master branch, then switch to master branch:

    ```sh
    git switch master
    ```

3. Create a new branch

    ```sh
    git checkout -b xfusioncorp_media
    ```

## Good to Know?

### Git Branching Fundamentals

- **Purpose**: Parallel development lines for features/fixes
- **Lightweight**: Branches are just pointers to commits
- **Isolation**: Changes in branches don't affect other branches
- **Merging**: Combine changes from different branches

### Branch Operations

- **Create**: `git branch branch-name` (create only)
- **Create + Switch**: `git checkout -b branch-name`
- **Switch**: `git checkout branch-name` or `git switch branch-name`
- **List**: `git branch` (local) or `git branch -a` (all)

### Branching Strategies

- **Feature Branches**: Separate branch for each feature
- **Git Flow**: master, develop, feature, release, hotfix branches
- **GitHub Flow**: Simple master + feature branch workflow
- **Release Branches**: Prepare releases without blocking development

### Best Practices

- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, meaningful branch names
- **Short-lived**: Keep feature branches small and focused
- **Regular Updates**: Sync with main branch frequently
- **Clean History**: Use meaningful commit messages
