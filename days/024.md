# Git Branch Create

Nautilus developers are actively working on one of the project repositories, `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/media`. Recently, they decided to implement some new features in the application, and they want to maintain those new changes in a separate branch. Below are the requirements that have been shared with the DevOps team:

- On Storage server in Stratos DC create a new branch `xfusioncorp_media` from master branch in `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/media` git repo.

- Please do not try to make any changes in the code.

## Steps

1. Login into storage server and run the following commands:

    ```sh
    sudo su
    cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/media
    ```

2. Let's check current branch

    ```sh
    git branch
    ```

    if current branch is n't master branch, then switch to master branch:

    ```sh
    git switch master
    ```

3. Create a new branch

    ```sh
    git checkout -b xfusioncorp_media
    ```
