# Creating a Docker Compose File

The Nautilus application development team shared static website content that needs to be hosted on the httpd web server using a containerised platform. The team has shared details with the DevOps team, and we need to set up an environment according to those guidelines. Below are the details:

- On App Server 3 in Stratos DC create a container named `httpd` using a docker compose file `/opt/docker/docker-compose.yml` (please use the exact name for file).

- Use `httpd` (preferably latest tag) image for container and make sure container is named as `httpd`; you can use any name for `service`.

- Map `80` number port of container with port `3003` of docker host.

- Map container's `/usr/local/apache2/htdocs` volume with `/opt/itadmin` volume of docker host which is already there. (please do not modify any data within these locations).

## Steps

1. Login into App Server 3
2. Make sure docker is running and accessible, you can check simply runing:

    ```sh
    docker ps
    ```

3. Let's create the `/opt/docker/docker-compose.yml` file:

    ```sh
    sudo touch /opt/docker/docker-compose.yml
    ```

    - Open the file in editor and copy paste the contents from this [file](../scripts/compose.yml)

4. Let's run the compose file

    ```sh
    docker compose -f /opt/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
    ```

5. Let's verify if it's running or not

    ```sh
    docker ps
    ```

    > It should display the output like this:

    ```shell
    banner@stapp03 ~]$ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND              CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                  NAMES
    31c6d90cafa8   httpd:latest   "httpd-foreground"   37 seconds ago   Up 35 seconds   0.0.0.0:3003->80/tcp   httpd
    ```

## Good to Know?

### Docker Compose

- **Purpose**: Define and run multi-container Docker applications
- **YAML Configuration**: Declarative service definitions
- **Orchestration**: Manage multiple containers as single application
- **Development**: Simplify local development environments

### Compose File Structure

- **version**: Compose file format version
- **services**: Define application containers
- **networks**: Custom network configuration
- **volumes**: Persistent data storage

### Service Configuration

- **image**: Docker image to use for container
- **container_name**: Custom name for container
- **ports**: Port mapping between host and container
- **volumes**: Mount host directories or named volumes
- **environment**: Set environment variables

### Compose Commands

- **Up**: `docker-compose up -d` (start services)
- **Down**: `docker-compose down` (stop and remove)
- **Logs**: `docker-compose logs` (view service logs)
- **Scale**: `docker-compose up --scale service=3`
