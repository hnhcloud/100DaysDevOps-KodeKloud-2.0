# Git Stash

The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/ecommerce` present on Storage server in Stratos DC. One of the developers stashed some in-progress changes in this repository, but now they want to restore some of the stashed changes. Find below more details to accomplish this task:

- Look for the stashed changes under `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/ecommerce` git repository, and restore the stash with stash@{1} identifier. Further, commit and push your changes to the origin.

## Steps

1. Login into storage server and move into repository

    ```sh
    sudo -i
    cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/ecommerce
    ```

2. Let's check the stash list:

    ```sh
    git stash list
    ```

    ```shell
    [root@ststor01 ecommerce]# git stash list
    stash@{0}: WIP on master: 7fe985d initial commit
    stash@{1}: WIP on master: 7fe985d initial commit
    ```

3. Restart stash files

    ```sh
    git stash apply stash@{1}
    ```

4. Push changes

    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Restored stash files"
    git push
    ```
