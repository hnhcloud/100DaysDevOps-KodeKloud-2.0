# Configure Git Hook

The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository /opt/demo.git which is cloned under /usr/src/kodekloudrepos directory present on Storage server in Stratos DC. The team want to setup a hook on this repository, please find below more details:

- Merge the feature branch into the master branch`, but before pushing your changes complete below point.

- Create a post-update hook in this git repository so that whenever any changes are pushed to the master branch, it creates a release tag with name release-2023-06-15, where 2023-06-15 is supposed to be the current date. For example if today is 20th June, 2023 then the release tag must be release-2023-06-20. Make sure you test the hook at least once and create a release tag for today's release.

- Finally remember to push your changes.

## Steps

1. Login into storage server and move into directory

    ```sh
    sudo -i
    cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo
    ```

2. Find the current branch and switch into master branch

    ```sh
    git branch
    git switch master
    ```

3. Merge the feature branch

    ```sh
    git merge feature
    ```

4. Add the script in hooks

    ```sh
    cp /opt/demo.git/hooks/post-update.sample /opt/demo.git/hooks/post-update
    chmod +x /opt/demo.git/hooks/post-update
    ```

5. Update script to push tags

    ```sh
    vi /opt/demo.git/hooks/post-update
    ```

    > Add these lines

    ```shell
    day=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")
    TAG="release-$day"

    git tag -a $TAG -m "Released at: $day"
    ```

6. Finally, push the changes

    ```sh
    git push
    ```

    > It will add a new tags and push it

    We can verify using these commands:

    ```sh
    git fetch --tags
    git tag
    ```
