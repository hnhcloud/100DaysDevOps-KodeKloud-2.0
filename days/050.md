# Set Resource Limits in Kubernetes Cluster

The Nautilus DevOps team has noticed performance issues in some Kubernetes-hosted applications due to resource constraints. To address this, they plan to set limits on resource utilization. Here are the details:

- Create a pod named `httpd-pod` with a container named `httpd-container`. Use the `httpd` image with the latest tag (specify as httpd:latest). Set the following resource limits:
- Requests: Memory: 15Mi, CPU: 100m
- Limits: Memory: 20Mi, CPU: 100m

> Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is configured to operate with the Kubernetes cluster.

## Steps

Let's create pod.yaml file with with these [contents](../files/k3s-pod.yml). Our updated file will be look like this:

```YAML
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: httpd-pod
    labels:
        app: httpd_pod
spec:
    containers:
        - name: httpd-container
          image: httpd:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
          resources:
            limits:
                cpu: 100m
                memory: 20Mi
            requests:
                cpu: 100m
                memory: 15Mi
```

- Let's create the pod:

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f pod.yml
    ```

- Verify pod:

    ```sh
    kubectl get pods
    ```
