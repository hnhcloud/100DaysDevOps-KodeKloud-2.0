# Troubleshoot Deployment Issues in Kubernetes

Last week, the Nautilus DevOps team deployed a redis app on Kubernetes cluster, which was working fine so far. This morning one of the team members was making some changes in this existing setup, but he made some mistakes and the app went down. We need to fix this as soon as possible. Please take a look.

- The deployment name is `redis-deployment`. The pods are not in running state right now, so please look into the issue and fix the same.

> Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

## Steps

1. Let's check the pod in details

    ```sh
    kubectl describe pod redis-deployment-pod-name
    ```

    ```shell
    thor@jumphost ~$ kubectl describe pod redis-deployment-6fd9d5fcb-k9n65
    Name:             redis-deployment-6fd9d5fcb-k9n65

    ```

    > It seems the pod is looking for a config-map that's not available or soemthing wrong

2. Let's see the list of configmaps

    ```sh
    kubectl get cm
    ```

    ```shell
    thor@jumphost ~$ kubectl get cm
    NAME               DATA   AGE
    kube-root-ca.crt   1      27m
    redis-config       2      8m16s
    ```

3. If you notice carefully, there is mismatch between name. The actual config-map name is: `redis-config` but pod is lokking for `redis-cofig`

4. Let's extract the deployment into a YAML file and fix it there

    ```sh
    kubectl get deployment.apps redis-deployment -o yaml > redis-deployment.yaml
    ```

5. Let's fix the deployment file `cofig` to `config` in volumes
6. Let's run the deployment

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f redis-deployment.yaml
    ```

7. Check pod status

    ```sh
    kubectl get pods
    ```

    > new error:

    ```shell
    thor@jumphost ~$ kubectl get pods
    NAME                                READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
    redis-deployment-5bcd4c7d64-rmcxj   0/1     ImagePullBackOff    0          4m9s
    ```

8. Let's fix the image tag `alpin` to `alpine`
9. Recreate the deployment

    ```sh
    kubectl delete deployments.apps redis-deployment
    kubectl apply -f redis-deployment
    ```

10. Verify the results

    ```kubectl get pods
    ```
