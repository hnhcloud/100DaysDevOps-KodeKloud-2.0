# Jenkins Database Backup Job

There is a requirement to create a Jenkins job to automate the database backup. Below you can find more details to accomplish this task:

Click on the Jenkins button on the top bar to access the Jenkins UI. Login using username admin and password Adm!n321.

1. Create a Jenkins job named `database-backup`.

2. Configure it to take a database dump of the `kodekloud_db01` database present on the `Database server` in `Stratos Datacenter`, the database user is `kodekloud_roy` and password is `asdfgdsd`.

3. The dump should be named in `db_$(date +%F).sql` format, where date `+%F` is the current date.

4. Copy the `db_$(date +%F).sql `dump to the Backup Server under location `/home/clint/db_backups`.

5. Further, schedule this job to run periodically at `*/10 * * * *`(please use this exact schedule format).

Note:

- You might need to install some plugins and restart Jenkins service. So, we recommend clicking on Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running on plugin installation/update page i.e update centre. Also, Jenkins UI sometimes gets stuck when Jenkins service restarts in the back end. In this case please make sure to refresh the UI page.

- Please make sure to define you cron expression like this `*/10 * * * *` (this is just an example to run job every 10 minutes).

- For these kind of scenarios requiring changes to be done in a web UI, please take screenshots so that you can share it with us for review in case your task is marked incomplete. You may also consider using a screen recording software such as loom.com to record and share your work.

## Steps

0. Update plugins and restart jenkins
1. Install the following plugin
    - SSH Credential
    - Publish Over SSH
2. Go to Manage Jenkins > System > Add SSH servers > Apply:

    ![ssh-servers](../screenshots/jenkins-add-ssh-servers.png)

3. Create a freestyle job named: `database-backup`:

    - Check build periodically and add this cron job: `*/10 * * * *`
    - Add build step > Send files or execute commands over ssh > add this lines in execute command:

    ```sh
    mkdir -p /tmp/db-backup
    mysqldump -u kodekloud_roy -p'asdfgdsd' kodekloud_db01 > /tmp/db-backup/db_$(date +%F).sql

    ls -la
    sudo apt install sshpass -y

    sshpass -p 'H@wk3y3' scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no /tmp/db-backup/*.sql clint@stbkp01:/home/clint/db_backups

    rm -rf /tmp/db-backup
    ```

    > It will create dump, transfer to backup and remove the backup from db server

4. Build job
