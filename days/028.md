# Git Cherry Pick

The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/official.git. This repo is cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC. They recently shared the following requirements with the DevOps team:

> There are two branches in this repository, master and feature. One of the developers is working on the feature branch and their work is still in progress, however they want to merge one of the commits from the feature branch to the master branch, the message for the commit that needs to be merged into master is Update info.txt. Accomplish this task for them, also remember to push your changes eventually.

## Steps

1. Login into Storage Server

2. Move into cloned repository

    ```sh
    sudo su
    cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/official
    ```

3. Check Git branches

    ```sh
    git branch
    ```

4. If you are already in feature branch?

    ```sh
    git log
    ```

    > take note of hash for specific commit we are going to merge into master branch

5. Switch to master branch to pick commit and push

    ```sh
    git switch master
    git cherry-pick commit-hash
    git push
    ```

## Good to Know?

### Cherry-Pick Fundamentals

- **Purpose**: Apply specific commits from one branch to another
- **Selective**: Choose individual commits, not entire branches
- **New Commit**: Creates new commit with same changes
- **Preserve Author**: Maintains original author information

### Cherry-Pick Use Cases

- **Bug Fixes**: Apply hotfixes to multiple branches
- **Feature Backporting**: Bring features to older versions
- **Selective Merging**: Include specific changes without full merge
- **Release Management**: Pick commits for release branches

### Cherry-Pick Options

- **Single Commit**: `git cherry-pick commit-hash`
- **Multiple Commits**: `git cherry-pick hash1 hash2`
- **Range**: `git cherry-pick start-hash..end-hash`
- **No Commit**: `git cherry-pick --no-commit` - Stage without committing

### Conflict Resolution

- **Automatic**: Git applies changes if no conflicts
- **Manual**: Resolve conflicts like in merge operations
- **Continue**: `git cherry-pick --continue` after resolving
- **Abort**: `git cherry-pick --abort` to cancel operation
