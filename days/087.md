# Ansible Install Package

The Nautilus Application development team wanted to test some applications on app servers in Stratos Datacenter. They shared some pre-requisites with the DevOps team, and packages need to be installed on app servers. Since we are already using Ansible for automating such tasks, please perform this task using Ansible as per details mentioned below:

- Create an inventory file `/home/thor/playbook/inventory` on jump host and add all app servers in it.

- Create an Ansible playbook `/home/thor/playbook/playbook.yml` to install `samba package` on all  app servers using `Ansible yum module`.

- Make sure user `thor` should be able to run the playbook on jump host.

> Note: Validation will try to run playbook using command `ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml` so please make sure playbook works this way, without passing any extra arguments.

## Steps

1. Move into playbook directory

    ```sh
    cd playbook
    ```

2. Create two files `inventory` and `playbook.yml`:

    ```sh
    touch inventory playbook.yml
    ```

3. Update inventory file with these contents:

    ```ini
    [app]
    stapp01 ansible_user=tony ansible_ssh_password=Ir0nM@n
    stapp02 ansible_user=steve ansible_ssh_password=Am3ric@
    stapp03 ansible_user=banner ansible_ssh_password=BigGr33n

    [all:vars]
    ansible_ssh_common_args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
    ```

4. Update the `playbook.yml` with the contents from this [playbook YAML file](../files/ansible_playbook_samba_package_install_87.yml)

5. Run the ansible playbook command:

    ```sh
    ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
    ```

## Good to Know?

### Ansible Package Management

- **yum Module**: Red Hat/CentOS package management
- **apt Module**: Debian/Ubuntu package management
- **package Module**: Generic package manager (auto-detects)
- **dnf Module**: Modern Red Hat package manager

### Package Operations

- **Install**: `state: present` or `state: installed`
- **Remove**: `state: absent` or `state: removed`
- **Update**: `state: latest` updates to newest version
- **Hold**: Prevent package updates

### Package Management Best Practices

- **Idempotency**: Safe to run multiple times
- **Version Pinning**: Specify exact versions for stability
- **Repository Management**: Ensure proper repositories configured
- **Dependency Handling**: Package managers handle dependencies

### Cross-Platform Considerations

- **Package Names**: May differ between distributions
- **Package Managers**: Different tools (yum, apt, dnf, zypper)
- **Repository Configuration**: Different repo formats
- **Service Names**: Services may have different names
