# Deploy Redis Deployment on Kubernetes

The Nautilus application development team observed some performance issues with one of the application that is deployed in Kubernetes cluster. After looking into number of factors, the team has suggested to use some in-memory caching utility for DB service. After number of discussions, they have decided to use Redis. Initially they would like to deploy Redis on kubernetes cluster for testing and later they will move it to production. Please find below more details about the task:

- Create a redis deployment with following parameters:

- Create a config map called `my-redis-config` having maxmemory `2mb` in `redis-config`.

- Name of the deployment should be `redis-deployment`, it should use `redis:alpine` image and container name should be `redis-container`. Also make sure it has only `1 replica`.

- The container should request for `1 CPU`.

Mount 2 volumes:

a. An Empty directory volume called `data` at path `/redis-master-data`.

b. A configmap volume called `redis-config` at path `/redis-master`.

c. The container should expose the port `6379`.

Finally, `redis-deployment` should be in an up and running state.
Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

## Steps

1. create a `k3s-deployment.yaml` file and copy-paste the contents from this [YAML file](../files/k3s-redis-deployment-065.yml)

2. Run the deployment

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f k3s-deployment.yaml
    ```

3. verify result

    ```sh
    kubectl get pods
    ```

## Good to Know?

### Redis on Kubernetes

- **In-Memory Database**: High-performance key-value store
- **Caching**: Improve application performance with caching
- **Data Structures**: Supports strings, hashes, lists, sets
- **Persistence**: Optional data persistence to disk

### ConfigMap Configuration

- **Redis Config**: Store Redis configuration in ConfigMap
- **Memory Limits**: Set maxmemory to prevent OOM
- **Eviction Policies**: Configure memory eviction strategies
- **Persistence**: Configure RDB or AOF persistence

### Resource Management

- **CPU Requests**: Redis is CPU-intensive for some operations
- **Memory Limits**: Set appropriate memory limits
- **Storage**: Use persistent volumes for data persistence
- **Monitoring**: Monitor memory usage and hit rates

### Production Considerations

- **High Availability**: Redis Sentinel or Cluster mode
- **Backup**: Regular backup of Redis data
- **Security**: Authentication and network policies
- **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling with Redis Cluster
