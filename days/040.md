# Docker Execution

One of the Nautilus DevOps team members was working to configure services on a kkloud container that is running on App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter. Due to some personal work he is on PTO for the rest of the week, but we need to finish his pending work ASAP. Please complete the remaining work as per details given below:

- Install `apache2` in `kkloud` container using apt that is running on `App Server 1` in Stratos Datacenter.

- Configure `Apache` to listen on port `6000` instead of default http port. Do not bind it to listen on specific IP or hostname only, i.e it should listen on localhost, 127.0.0.1, container ip, etc.

- Make sure Apache service is up and running inside the container. Keep the container in running state at the end.

## Steps

1. Login into App Server using SSH
2. Let's check the running containers

    ```sh
    docker ps
    ```

    ```shell
    [tony@stapp01 ~]$ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND       CREATED         STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
    dcdc693d1175   ubuntu:18.04   "/bin/bash"   8 minutes ago   Up 8 minutes             kkloud
    ```

3. Login inside the container

    ```sh
    docker exec -it kkloud /bin/bash
    ```

    ```output
    [tony@stapp01 ~]$ docker exec -it kkloud /bin/bash
    root@dcdc693d1175:/#
    ```

4. Install apache2 inside the container

    So, we are already inside the container. lets run the following command to install apache2:

    ```sh
    apt install apache2 vim -y
    ```

    > We have installed apache2 and vim

5. Configure Apache2

    We have installed apache2 and vim so far. Now let's configure Apache2 to change the default port 80 to 6000. 

    To modify port, we have to edit file in `/etc/apache2/ports.conf`:

    ```sh
    vim /etc/apache2/ports.conf
    ```

    ```conf
    # If you just change the port or add more ports here, you will likely also
    # have to change the VirtualHost statement in
    # /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf

    Listen 80

    <IfModule ssl_module>
            Listen 443
    </IfModule>

    <IfModule mod_gnutls.c>
            Listen 443
    </IfModule>

    # vim: syntax=apache ts=4 sw=4 sts=4 sr noet
    ```

    > just change 80 to 6000

    Another part is to update the `000-default.conf`.
    Just changed 80 to 6000:

    ```conf
    <VirtualHost *:6000>
        # The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
        # the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
        # redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
        # specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
        # match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
        # value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
        # However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.
        #ServerName www.example.com

        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html

        # Available loglevels: trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn,
        # error, crit, alert, emerg.
        # It is also possible to configure the loglevel for particular
        # modules, e.g.
        #LogLevel info ssl:warn

        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

        # For most configuration files from conf-available/, which are
        # enabled or disabled at a global level, it is possible to
        # include a line for only one particular virtual host. For example the
        # following line enables the CGI configuration for this host only
        # after it has been globally disabled with "a2disconf".
        #Include conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf
    </VirtualHost>

    # vim: syntax=apache ts=4 sw=4 sts=4 sr noet
    ```

6. Let's start the apache2 service

    To run apache2 service inside the container:

    ```sh
    /usr/sbin/apache2ctl start
    ```

    To verify if apache2 is started or not:

    ```sh
    ps aux | grep apache2
    ```

    > It will show running process of apache2

    ```output
    root@dcdc693d1175:~# ps aux | grep apache2
    root         116  0.0  0.0  73972  4632 ?        Ss   02:12   0:00 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
    www-data     117  0.0  0.0 2067072 4464 ?        Sl   02:12   0:00 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
    www-data     118  0.0  0.0 2067072 4464 ?        Sl   02:12   0:00 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
    root         174  0.0  0.0  11472  1076 pts/1    S+   02:13   0:00 grep --color=auto apache2
    ```

    To test if apache2 is running or not:

    ```sh
    curl localhost:6000
    ```
