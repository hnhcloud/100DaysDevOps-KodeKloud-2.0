## Good to Know?

### Git Forking Concepts

- **Purpose**: Create personal copy of someone else's repository
- **Independence**: Fork is separate from original repository
- **Contribution**: Common workflow for open source contributions
- **Ownership**: You own and control your fork

### Fork vs Clone

- **Fork**: Server-side copy (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea)
- **Clone**: Local copy on your machine
- **Relationship**: Fork maintains connection to original
- **Workflow**: Fork → Clone → Modify → Pull Request

### Collaboration Workflow

1. **Fork**: Create your copy of the repository
2. **Clone**: Download fork to local machine
3. **Branch**: Create feature branch for changes
4. **Commit**: Make and commit your changes
5. **Push**: Upload changes to your fork
6. **Pull Request**: Propose changes to original repository

### Gitea Features

- **Self-hosted**: Git service similar to GitHub
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource requirements
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly repository management
- **Collaboration**: Issues, pull requests, wikis
