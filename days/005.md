# Install and Configuration Selinux

Following a security audit, the xFusionCorp Industries security team has opted to enhance application and server security with SELinux. To initiate testing, the following requirements have been established for App server 2 in the Stratos Datacenter:

- Install the required SELinux packages.
- Permanently disable SELinux for the time being; it will be re-enabled after necessary configuration changes.
- No need to reboot the server, as a scheduled maintenance reboot is already planned for tonight.
- Disregard the current status of SELinux via the command line; the final status after the reboot should be disabled.

## Steps

1. Install selinux packages:

    ```sh
    sudo dnf install selinux-policy selinux-policy-targeted policycoreutils policycoreutils-python-utils
    ```

2. Modify file in `/etc/selinux/config:

    ```sh
    vi /etc/selinux/config
    ```

    add this line:

    ```nano
    SELINUX=disabled
    ```
