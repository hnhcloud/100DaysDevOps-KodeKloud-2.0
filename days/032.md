# Git Rebase

The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/games.git. This repo is cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC. They recently shared the following requirements with DevOps team:

> One of the developers is working on feature branch and their work is still in progress, however there are some changes which have been pushed into the master branch, the developer now wants to rebase the feature branch with the master branch without loosing any data from the feature branch, also they don't want to add any merge commit by simply merging the master branch into the feature branch. Accomplish this task as per requirements mentioned.

- Also remember to push your changes once done.

## Steps

1. Login into storage server and move into repository

    ```sh
    sudo -i
    cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games
    ```

2. Be confirmed that we are in `feature` branch

    ```sh
    git branch
    ```

3. Rebase master branch

    ```sh
    git rebase master
    ```

4. Push feature branch

    ```sh
    git push --force --set-upstream origin feature
    ```

## Good to Know?

### Rebase vs Merge

- **Rebase**: Replays commits on top of target branch (linear history)
- **Merge**: Combines branches with merge commit (preserves context)
- **History**: Rebase creates cleaner, linear history
- **Traceability**: Merge preserves original branch structure

### Rebase Benefits

- **Clean History**: Linear commit sequence
- **No Merge Commits**: Avoids cluttered merge commits
- **Easier Bisect**: Simpler to find bugs with git bisect
- **Professional**: Cleaner project history

### Rebase Risks

- **Shared Branches**: Never rebase published commits
- **Force Push**: Required after rebasing pushed commits
- **Conflicts**: May need to resolve conflicts multiple times
- **Lost Context**: Loses information about when branches diverged

### Interactive Rebase

- **Edit History**: `git rebase -i HEAD~n`
- **Squash**: Combine multiple commits
- **Reword**: Change commit messages
- **Reorder**: Change commit sequence
- **Drop**: Remove commits entirely
