# Docker Ports Mapping

The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to host an application on a nginx-based container. There are number of tickets already been created for similar tasks. One of the tickets has been assigned to set up a nginx container on Application Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter. Please perform the task as per details mentioned below:

- Pull `nginx:stable` docker image on Application Server 2.

- Create a container named `cluster` using the image you pulled.

- Map host port `5002` to container port `80`. Please keep the container in running state.

## Steps

1. Login into App Server 2
2. Pull the docker image

    ```sh
    docker pull nginx:stable
    ```

3. Create a container with port mapping

    ```sh
    docker run -d --name cluster -p 5002:80 nginx:stable
    ```

4. Make sure container is running

    ```sh
    docker ps
    ```
