# Linux User Setup with Non-interactive Shell

Create a user with non-interactive shell for your organization on a specific server.

## Steps

1. First, login into the app server using `SSH`:

    ```sh
    ssh user@app-server-ip
    ```

    > It will ask for user password, enter the correct password.

2. After login into server, run the following command to create user with non-interactive shell

    ```sh
    sudo useradd -m -s /usr/sbin/nologin user-name
    ```

    `s`: for shell, here we are giving nologin shell

    `m`: for user home directory, It will create a directory with user-name under /home

3. Verify the result

    ```sh
    cat /etc/passwd
    ```

    It should give you a list of users where you will find your created user. It will look like this:
    `kareem:x:1003:1004::/home/kareem:/usr/sbin/nologin`

    Try to login using:

    ```sh
    sudo su user-name
    ```

    Output: `This account is currently not available.`
