# Set Up Jenkins Server

The DevOps team at xFusionCorp Industries is initiating the setup of CI/CD pipelines and has decided to utilize Jenkins as their server. Execute the task according to the provided requirements:

1. Install Jenkins on the jenkins server using the yum utility only, and start its service.
    - If you face a timeout issue while starting the Jenkins service, refer to [this](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/system-administration/systemd-services/#starting-services).
2. Jenkin's admin user name should be `theadmin`, password should be `Adm!n321`, full name should be `John` and email should be `john@jenkins.stratos.xfusioncorp.com`.

Note:

1. To access the jenkins server, connect from the jump host using the `root` user with the password `S3curePass`.

2. After Jenkins server installation, click the Jenkins button on the top bar to access the Jenkins UI and follow on-screen instructions to create an admin user.

## Steps

1. Login into jenkins server and find operating system

    ```bash
    ssh root@jenkins
    ```

    ```shell
     cat /etc/os-release 
    NAME="CentOS Stream"
    VERSION="9"
    ID="centos"
    ID_LIKE="rhel fedora"
    VERSION_ID="9"
    PLATFORM_ID="platform:el9"
    PRETTY_NAME="CentOS Stream 9"
    ANSI_COLOR="0;31"
    LOGO="fedora-logo-icon"
    CPE_NAME="cpe:/o:centos:centos:9"
    HOME_URL="https://centos.org/"
    BUG_REPORT_URL="https://issues.redhat.com/"
    REDHAT_SUPPORT_PRODUCT="Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9"
    REDHAT_SUPPORT_PRODUCT_VERSION="CentOS Stream"
    ```

    > We can see its' centos 9 os based server

2. Run the following command to update packages:

    ```sh
    yum update -y
    yum install -y wget
    ```

3. We will install jenkins for fedora with stable version, following this [[Documentation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/#fedora-stable)]

    ```sh
    sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
    sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
    sudo dnf upgrade -y
    # Add required dependencies for the jenkins package
    sudo dnf install fontconfig java-21-openjdk -y
    sudo dnf install jenkins -y
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

4. Start Jenkins server

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl enable --now jenkins
    ```

5. Copy the password:

    ```sh
    cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
    ```

6. Login into Jenkins UI and Setup Jenkins

    - Paste the initial password
    - Install suggested plugins (it will take some time)
    - Continue (skil retry)
    - set: username, password, confirm password, full name and email
    - Save and Continue > Save and Finish
    - Start Jenkins
    - Done
