# Using Ansible Conditions

The Nautilus DevOps team had a discussion about, how they can train different team members to use Ansible for different automation tasks. There are numerous ways to perform a particular task using Ansible, but we want to utilize each aspect that Ansible offers. The team wants to utilise Ansible's conditionals to perform the following task:

An inventory file is already placed under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host, with all the Stratos DC app servers included.

Create a playbook /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml and make sure to use Ansible's when conditionals statements to perform the below given tasks.

1. Copy `blog.txt` file present under `/usr/src/itadmin` directory on jump host to `App Server 1` under `/opt/itadmin` directory. Its user and group owner must be user tony and its permissions must be 0655 .

2. Copy `story.txt` file present under `/usr/src/itadmin` directory on jump host to `App Server 2` under `/opt/itadmin` directory. Its user and group owner must be user steve and its permissions must be 0655 .

3. Copy `media.txt` file present under `/usr/src/itadmin` directory on jump host to `App Server 3` under `/opt/itadmin` directory. Its user and group owner must be user banner and its permissions must be 0655.

> NOTE:

- You can use `ansible_nodename` variable from gathered facts with when condition. Additionally, please make sure you are running the play for all hosts i.e use - hosts: all.

- Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml, so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.

## Steps

0. Move into ansible directory and check files

    ```sh
    cd ansible
    ls -la
    cat inventory
    ```

1. Create an empty `playbook.yml` file

    ```sh
    touch playbook.yml
    ```

2. Update `playbook.yml` with the contents from this [YAML file](../files/ansible_playbook_conditions_093.yml)

    - Make sure you have update `src path` and `mode` based on your task description

3. Run the playbook

    ```sh
    ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
    ```

4. Verify

    - login into each app server and run the command

    ```sh
    ls -la /opt/itadmin
    ```
