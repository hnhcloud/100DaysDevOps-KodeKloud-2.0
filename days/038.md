## Good to Know?

### Docker Image Management

- **Images**: Read-only templates for creating containers
- **Layers**: Images built in layers for efficiency
- **Registry**: Central repository for storing images (Docker Hub)
- **Tags**: Labels to identify different versions of images

### Image Operations

- **Pull**: `docker pull image:tag` - Download from registry
- **List**: `docker images` - Show local images
- **Remove**: `docker rmi image:tag` - Delete local image
- **Build**: `docker build -t name:tag .` - Create from Dockerfile

### Tagging Strategy

- **Semantic Versioning**: Use version numbers (1.0.0, 1.1.0)
- **Environment Tags**: dev, staging, prod
- **Latest Tag**: Points to most recent version
- **Descriptive Tags**: Include purpose or feature name

### BusyBox Image

- **Minimal**: Tiny Linux distribution (~1MB)
- **Utilities**: Common Unix utilities in single executable
- **Debugging**: Useful for troubleshooting containers
- **Base Image**: Often used as minimal base for custom images
