# Persistent Volumes in Kubernetes

The Nautilus DevOps team is working on a Kubernetes template to deploy a web application on the cluster. There are some requirements to create/use persistent volumes to store the application code, and the template needs to be designed accordingly. Please find more details below:

- Create a `PersistentVolume` named as `pv-xfusion`. Configure the `spec` as storage class should be `manual`, set capacity to `3Gi`, set access mode to `ReadWriteOnce`, volume type should be `hostPath` and set path to `/mnt/security` (this directory is already created, you might not be able to access it directly, so you need not to worry about it).
- Create a `PersistentVolumeClaim` named as `pvc-xfusion`. Configure the spec as storage class should be `manual`, request `3Gi` of the storage, set access mode to `ReadWriteOnce`.
- Create a `pod` named as `pod-xfusion`, mount the persistent volume you created with claim name `pvc-xfusion` at document root of the web server, the container within the pod should be named as `container-xfusion` using image `httpd` with latest tag only (remember to mention the tag i.e `httpd:latest`).
- Create a node port type service named `web-xfusion` using node port `30008` to expose the web server running within the pod.

> Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

## Steps

1. Create a persistent volume `k3s-pv.yaml` with this content:

    ```YAML
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolume
    metadata:
    name: pv-xfusion
    spec:
    capacity:
        storage: 3Gi
    accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
    storageClassName: manual
    hostPath:
        path: /mnt/security
    ```

    > Create the volume:

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f k3s-pv.yaml
    ```

2. Create the persistent volume claim `k3s-pvc.yaml` with this following content:

    ```YAML
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    metadata:
    name: pvc-xfusion
    spec:
    accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
        requests:
        storage: 3Gi
    storageClassName: manual
    ```

    To create the pvc:

    ```sh
    kubectl k3s-pvc.yaml
    ```

3. Create the pod `k3s-pod.yaml`:

    ```YAML
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
    name: pod-xfusion
    labels:
        app: xfusion
    spec:
    containers:
        - name: container-xfusion
        image: httpd:latest
        volumeMounts:
            - name: xfusion-volume
            mountPath: /mnt/security
        resources:
            limits:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
            requests:
            memory: "64Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
    volumes:
        - name: xfusion-volume
        persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: pvc-xfusion
    ```

    > run the pod

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f k3s-pod.yaml
    ```

4. And finally, create the service `k3s-svc.yaml`:

    ```YAML
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
    name: web-xfusion
    labels:
        app: xfusion
    spec:
    type: NodePort
    ports:
        - port: 80
        targetPort: 80
        nodePort: 30008
    selector:
        app: xfusion
    ```

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f k3s-svc.yaml
    ```

5. We can put all in one file [k3s-pod.yaml](../files/k3s-pod-060.yaml)
