# Copy File to Docker Container

The Nautilus DevOps team is conducting application deployment tests on selected application servers. They require completing a task on app server 1.

On Application Server 1 a container named ubuntu_latest is running, you have to copy the encrypted file `/tmp/nautilus.tx.gpg` from docker hosts to container folder `/usr/src`.

## Steps

Login into App Server and run the following command:

```sh
docker cp /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg ubuntu_latest:/usr/src/
```

## Good to Know?

### Docker Copy Operations

- **Purpose**: Transfer files between host and containers
- **Bidirectional**: Copy from host to container or vice versa
- **Running Containers**: Works with both running and stopped containers
- **Preserve Permissions**: Maintains file ownership and permissions

### Copy Command Syntax

- **Host to Container**: `docker cp /host/path container:/container/path`
- **Container to Host**: `docker cp container:/container/path /host/path`
- **Directory Copy**: Use `-a` flag to preserve attributes
- **Recursive**: Automatically copies directories recursively

### Use Cases

- **Configuration**: Deploy config files to containers
- **Logs**: Extract log files for analysis
- **Debugging**: Copy files for troubleshooting
- **Backup**: Extract data from containers

### Best Practices

- **Volume Mounts**: Prefer volumes for persistent data
- **Build Time**: Use COPY in Dockerfile for build-time files
- **Security**: Be cautious with file permissions
- **Temporary**: Use docker cp for temporary file transfers
