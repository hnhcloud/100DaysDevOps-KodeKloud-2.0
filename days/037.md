# Copy File to Docker Container

The Nautilus DevOps team is conducting application deployment tests on selected application servers. They require completing a task on app server 1.

On Application Server 1 a container named ubuntu_latest is running, you have to copy the encrypted file `/tmp/nautilus.tx.gpg` from docker hosts to container folder `/usr/src`.

## Steps

Login into App Server and run the following command:

```sh
docker cp /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg ubuntu_latest:/usr/src/
```
