# Deploy Applications with Kubernetes Deployments

The Nautilus DevOps team is delving into Kubernetes for app management. One team member needs to create a deployment following these details:

Create a deployment named nginx to deploy the application nginx using the image nginx:latest (ensure to specify the tag)

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is set up to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.

## Steps

Let's create the `k3s-deployment.yml` file with these contents:

```YAML
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    app: nginx

spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:latest
          ports:
          - containerPort: 80
```

- Run the following commands to create the deployment:

  ```sh
  kubectl apply -f k3s-deployment.yml
  ```

- Verify Deployments

  ```sh
  kubectl get deployments.apps
  ```
