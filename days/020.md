# Configure Nginx + PHP-FPM Using Unix Sock

The Nautilus application development team is planning to launch a new PHP-based application, which they want to deploy on Nautilus infra in Stratos DC. The development team had a meeting with the production support team and they have shared some requirements regarding the infrastructure. Below are the requirements they shared:

- Install `nginx` on `app server 1` , configure it to use port `8093` and its document `root` should be `/var/www/html`.
- Install `php-fpm` version `8.2` on `app server 1`, it must use the unix socket `/var/run/php-fpm/default.sock` (create the parent directories if don't exist).
- Configure `php-fpm` and `nginx` to work together.
- Once configured correctly, you can test the website using `curl http://stapp01:8093/index.php` command from jump host.

## Steps

1. Login into App Server and run the following commands:

    ```sh
    sudo dnf update -y
    sudo dnf install nginx -y
    sudo dnf module install php:8.2 -y # change version here if requires
    ```

    - It will update packge repo
    - Install nginx and php with expected version

2. Configure php-fpm config:

    ```sh
    sudo mkdir -p /var/run/php-fpm
    sudo vi /etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf
    ```

    - `listen = /run/php-fpm/www.sock` update this line with expected directory. It should be `listen = /var/run/php-fpm/default.sock`

3. Configure nginx

    ```sh
    sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    ```

    - change port 80 to `8093`

4. Configure php with nginx

    ```sh
    sudo vi /etc/nginx/default.d/php.conf
    ```

    - Update `fastcgi_pass php-fpm;` to this: `fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php-fpm/default.sock;`

5. Restart php-fpm and nginx

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl enable --now nginx
    sudo systemctl enable --now php-fpm
    ```

6. Test: `curl http://stapp01:8093/index.php`

## Good to Know?

### PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager)

- **Purpose**: High-performance PHP FastCGI implementation
- **Process Management**: Manages PHP worker processes
- **Performance**: Better than mod_php for high-traffic sites
- **Isolation**: Separate processes for different applications

### Communication Methods

- **Unix Sockets**: Faster, local communication only
- **TCP Sockets**: Network communication, can be remote
- **Performance**: Unix sockets generally faster for local communication
- **Security**: Unix sockets more secure (filesystem permissions)

### NGINX + PHP-FPM Benefits

- **Scalability**: Handle more concurrent connections
- **Resource Efficiency**: Lower memory usage
- **Stability**: PHP crashes don't affect web server
- **Flexibility**: Different PHP versions per application

### Configuration Best Practices

- **Process Management**: Configure pm.max_children appropriately
- **Socket Permissions**: Ensure NGINX can access PHP-FPM socket
- **Security**: Run PHP-FPM as dedicated user
- **Monitoring**: Enable status page for monitoring
