# Kubernetes Shared Volumes

We are working on an application that will be deployed on multiple containers within a pod on Kubernetes cluster. There is a requirement to share a volume among the containers to save some temporary data. The Nautilus DevOps team is developing a similar template to replicate the scenario. Below you can find more details about it.

- Create a pod named `volume-share-nautilus`.

- For the first container, use image `fedora` with `latest` tag only and remember to mention the tag i.e `fedora:latest`, container should be named as `volume-container-nautilus-1`, and run a sleep command for it so that it remains in running state. Volume `volume-share` should be mounted at path `/tmp/news`.

- For the second container, use image fedora with the latest tag only and remember to mention the tag i.e `fedora:latest`, container should be named as `volume-container-nautilus-2`, and again run a sleep command for it so that it remains in running state. Volume `volume-share` should be mounted at path `/tmp/demo`.

- Volume name should be `volume-share` of type `emptyDir`.

- After creating the pod, exec into the first container i.e `volume-container-nautilus-1`, and just for testing create a file `news.txt` with any content under the mounted path of first container i.e `/tmp/news`.

- The file `news.txt` should be present under the mounted path `/tmp/demo` on the second container `volume-container-nautilus-2` as well, since they are using a shared volume.

> Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

## Steps

1. Let's create the `k3s-pod.yml` file using the [contnets](../files/k3s-shared-volume.yml)

2. Create the pod

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f k3s-pod.yml
    ```

3. Execute the first container

    ```sh
    kubectl exec -it volume-share-nautilus -c volume-container-nautilus-1 /bin/sh
    ```

    > Create `news.txt` file

    ```sh
    touch /tmp/news/news.txt
    ```

4. Execute the 2nd container

    ```sh
    kubectl exec -it volume-share-nautilus -c volume-container-nautilus-2 /bin/sh
    ```

    > Verify the created files under shared directory

    ```sh
    ls /tmp/demo
    ```

## Good to Know?

### Shared Volumes

- **emptyDir**: Temporary storage shared between containers
- **Pod Lifetime**: Volume exists for pod's lifetime
- **Memory Storage**: Can use memory as storage medium
- **Data Sharing**: Enable inter-container communication

### Volume Types

- **emptyDir**: Empty directory, deleted when pod removed
- **hostPath**: Mount directory from host node
- **persistentVolumeClaim**: Persistent storage
- **configMap/secret**: Configuration and sensitive data

### Multi-Container Use Cases

- **Log Shipping**: Sidecar collects and ships logs
- **Data Processing**: One container produces, another consumes
- **Configuration Sharing**: Share config files between containers
- **Backup Operations**: Backup container accesses main app data

### Container Communication

- **Shared Filesystem**: Files written by one, read by another
- **Localhost Network**: Containers share network namespace
- **Process Signals**: Containers can send signals to each other
- **Resource Sharing**: Share CPU, memory, and storage resources
