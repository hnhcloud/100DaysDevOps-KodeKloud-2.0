# Print Environment Variables

The Nautilus DevOps team is working on to setup some pre-requisites for an application that will send the greetings to different users. There is a sample deployment, that needs to be tested. Below is a scenario which needs to be configured on Kubernetes cluster. Please find below more details about it.

- Create a pod named `print-envars-greeting`.

- Configure spec as, the container name should be print-env-container and use bash image.

- Create three environment variables:

  - GREETING and its value should be Welcome to

  - COMPANY and its value should be xFusionCorp

  - GROUP and its value should be Group

- Use command ["/bin/sh", "-c", 'echo "$(GREETING) $(COMPANY) $(GROUP)"'] (please use this exact command), also set its restartPolicy policy to Never to avoid crash loop back.

- You can check the output using kubectl logs -f print-envars-greeting command.

> Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

## Steps

1. Create a `k3s-pod.yml` using this [YAML file](../files/k3s-pod-057.yaml)
2. Let's run the following command to create the pod:

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f k3s-pod.yml
    ```

3. Verify results

    ```sh
    kubectl logs -f print-env-greeting
    ```

    > It should print the environment variables as per command we have used in the container

## Good to Know?

### Environment Variables

- **Configuration**: Pass configuration to containers
- **Secrets**: Store sensitive information securely
- **Service Discovery**: Kubernetes injects service information
- **Runtime Configuration**: Modify behavior without rebuilding images

### Variable Sources

- **Direct Values**: Hardcoded values in pod spec
- **ConfigMaps**: Non-sensitive configuration data
- **Secrets**: Sensitive data like passwords and keys
- **Field References**: Pod/container metadata
- **Resource References**: CPU/memory limits and requests

### Best Practices

- **Externalize Config**: Keep configuration outside images
- **Use ConfigMaps**: For non-sensitive configuration
- **Use Secrets**: For passwords, tokens, certificates
- **Validation**: Validate environment variables in application

### Pod Lifecycle

- **Init Containers**: Run before main containers
- **Restart Policy**: Never, Always, OnFailure
- **Completion**: Pod completes when all containers exit
- **Job Pattern**: Use for batch processing tasks
