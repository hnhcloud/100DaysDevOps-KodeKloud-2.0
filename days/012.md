# Linux Network Services

Our monitoring tool has reported an issue in Stratos Datacenter. One of our app servers has an issue, as its Apache service is not reachable on port 3000 (which is the Apache port). The service itself could be down, the firewall could be at fault, or something else could be causing the issue.

- Use tools like telnet, netstat, etc. to find and fix the issue. Also make sure Apache is reachable from the jump host without compromising any security settings.

- Once fixed, you can test the same using command `curl http://stapp01:3000` command from jump host.

## Steps

1. Login into app server.
2. Check `httpd/apache/nginx` service status

    ```shell
    tony@stapp01 ~]$ sudo systemctl status httpd
    ● httpd.service - The Apache HTTP Server
    Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service; disabled; vendor preset
    : disabled)
    Active: failed (Result: exit-code) since Wed 2025-08-06 01:38:21 UT
    C; 13min ago

    Process: 491 ExecStart=/usr/sbin/httpd $OPTIONS -DFOREGROUND (code=exit
    ed, status=1/FAILURE)
    Main PID: 491 (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)
    Status: "Reading configuration..."

    n use: AH00072: make_sock: could not bind to address 0.0.0.0:3000
    Aug 06 01:38:21 stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com httpd[491]: no listening sockets 
    available, shutting down
    top -
    ```

3. Lets check the network port status

    ```sh
    sudo netstat -tlnup
    ```

    ```txt
    Active Internet connections (only servers)
    Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name    
    tcp        0      0 127.0.0.11:36025        0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      -                   
    tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:3000          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      430/sendmail: accep 
    tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      298/sshd            
    tcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN      298/sshd            
    udp        0      0 127.0.0.11:56145        0.0.0.0:*                           -                   
    ```

    > It's clearly visible that the '3000' port is already being used by `sendmail`

4. So Either we need to change port 3000 on sendmail or we can run httpd on different port. Since target is to run apache on 3000, we have to change sendmail port.

5. Changing sendmail port

    ```sh
    cd /etc/mail
    cp sendmail.mc sendmail.mc.bak
    vi sendmail.mc
    ```

    Find the following line and change port with some other value (i,e; `1234`):

    ```sh
    DAEMON_OPTIONS(`Port=3000,Addr=127.0.0.1, Name=MTA')dnl
    ```

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl restart sendmail
    ```

6. Now lets check port and servicec status

    ```sh
    sudo netstat -tlnup
    sudo systemctl status httpd sendmail
    ```

7. Test

    From app server:

    ```sh
    curl http://localhost:3000
    ```

    From jump host:

    ```sh
    curl http://stapp01:3000
    ```

8. Debugging and Decision
    - From `netstat` we can see port `3000` listening on all interfaces.
    - `ifconfig` we can see jump host and app server connected with route
    - if we use `telnet` we see its giving no route to host.
    So we should check the firewall.

9. Fixing firewall using `iptables`

    ```sh
    sudo iptables -L -n
    ```

    ```bash
    sudo iptables -L -n
    Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
    target     prot opt source               destination         
    ACCEPT     all  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            state RELATED,ESTABLISHED
    ACCEPT     icmp --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0           
    ACCEPT     all  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0           
    ACCEPT     tcp  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            state NEW tcp dpt:22
    REJECT     all  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            reject-with icmp-host-prohibited

    Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
    target     prot opt source               destination         
    REJECT     all  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            reject-with icmp-host-prohibited

    Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
    target     prot opt source               destination         
    # Warning: iptables-legacy tables present, use iptables-legacy to see them
    ```

    That `FORWARD` rule is blocking the connection.

    Run the following command:

    ```sh
    sudo iptables -I INPUT 4 -p tcp --dport 3000 -j ACCEPT
    ```

10. Finally it should work: `curl http://stapp01:3000`
