# Git Manage Remotes

The xFusionCorp development team added updates to the project that is maintained under /opt/beta.git repo and cloned under /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta. Recently some changes were made on Git server that is hosted on Storage server in Stratos DC. The DevOps team added some new Git remotes, so we need to update remote on /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta repository as per details mentioned below:

- In `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta` repo add a new remote `dev_beta` and point it to `/opt/xfusioncorp_beta.git` repository.
- There is a file `/tmp/index.html` on same server; copy this file to the repo and `add/commit` to `master branch`.
- Finally `push master branch` to this new `remote origin`.

## Steps

1. Login into storage server
2. move into repo directory

    ```sh
    sudo su
    cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta
    ```

3. Check current remote and branch:

    ```sh
    git remote -v
    git branch
    ```

4. Add new remote and check if it's added or not

    ```sh
    git remote add dev_beta /opt/xfusioncorp_beta.git
    git remote -v
    ```

5. Copy file and commit changes

    ```sh
    cp /tmp/index.html .
    git add .
    git commit -m "added tmp file"
    ```

6. Finallt, Push the changes to dev_beta remote

    ```sh
    git push dev_beta master
    ```
