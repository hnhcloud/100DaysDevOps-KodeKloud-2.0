# Day2: Temporary User Setup with Expiry Date

As part of the temporary assignment to the Nautilus project, a developer named yousuf requires access for a limited duration. To ensure smooth access management, a temporary user account with an expiry date is needed. Here's what you need to do:

> Create a user named `yousuf` on `App Server 1` in Stratos Datacenter. Set the expiry date to `2024-01-28`, ensuring the user is created in lowercase as per standard protocol.

## Steps

1. Follow the [Day 01](./001.md) to connect server and run the following command:

    ```sh
    sudo useradd -m -e 2024-01-28 yousuf
    ```

2. Verify

    ```sh
    cat /etc/passwd
    sudo su yousuf
    ```
