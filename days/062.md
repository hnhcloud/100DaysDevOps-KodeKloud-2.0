# Manage Secrets in Kubernetes

The Nautilus DevOps team is working to deploy some tools in Kubernetes cluster. Some of the tools are licence based so that licence information needs to be stored securely within Kubernetes cluster. Therefore, the team wants to utilize Kubernetes secrets to store those secrets. Below you can find more details about the requirements:

- We already have a secret key file `media.txt` under `/opt` location on jump host. Create a generic secret named `media`, it should contain the password/license-number present in `media.txt` file.

- Also create a pod named `secret-devops`.

- Configure pod's spec as container name should be `secret-container-devops`, image should be `debian` with latest tag (remember to mention the tag with image). Use sleep command for container so that it remains in running state. Consume the created secret and mount it under `/opt/cluster` within the container.

- To verify you can exec into the container `secret-container-devops`, to check the secret key under the mounted path `/opt/cluster`. Before hitting the Check button please make sure pod/pods are in running state, also validation can take some time to complete so keep patience.

> Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

## Steps

1. To create a generic secret from file:

    ```sh
    kubectl create secret generic media --from-file=/opt/media.txt
    ```

    > To check:

    ```sh
    kubectl describe secret media
    ```

2. Create the `k3s-pod.yaml` file, copy-paste contents from this [YAML file](../files/k3s-pod-062.yaml)

3. Run the pod

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f k3s-pod.yaml
    ```

4. Verify results

    ```sh
    kubectl get secret
    kubectl get pod
    kubectl exec -it secret-devops -c secret-container-devops -- cat /opt/cluster
    ```

    > You can see secret data, running pods and execute the command to verify the secret is placed inside the container

## Good to Know?

### Kubernetes Secrets

- **Purpose**: Store sensitive information (passwords, tokens, keys)
- **Base64 Encoding**: Data is base64 encoded (not encrypted)
- **Namespace Scoped**: Secrets belong to specific namespace
- **Volume Mounts**: Mount secrets as files in containers

### Secret Types

- **generic**: Arbitrary user-defined data
- **docker-registry**: Docker registry credentials
- **tls**: TLS certificates and keys
- **service-account-token**: Service account tokens

### Secret Usage

- **Environment Variables**: Inject as env vars
- **Volume Mounts**: Mount as files in filesystem
- **Image Pull Secrets**: Authenticate to private registries
- **Service Account**: Automatic token injection

### Security Best Practices

- **RBAC**: Control access to secrets
- **Encryption at Rest**: Enable etcd encryption
- **Rotation**: Regularly rotate secrets
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimal required access
- **External Systems**: Consider external secret management
