# Managing ACLs Using Ansible

There are some files that need to be created on all app servers in Stratos DC. The Nautilus DevOps team want these files to be owned by user root only however, they also want that the app specific user to have a set of permissions on these files. All tasks must be done using Ansible only, so they need to create a playbook. Below you can find more information about the task.

Create a playbook named `playbook.yml` under `/home/thor/ansible` directory on jump host, an inventory file is already present under `/home/thor/ansible directory` on Jump Server itself.

1. Create an empty file `blog.txt` under `/opt/devops/` directory on app server 1. Set some acl properties for this file. Using acl provide `read '(r)' permissions to group tony` (i.e entity is tony and etype is group).

2. Create an empty file `story.txt` under `/opt/devops/` directory on app server 2. Set some acl properties for this file. Using acl provide `read + write '(rw)'` permissions to `user` `steve` (i.e entity is steve and etype is user).

3. Create an empty file `media.txt` under `/opt/devops/` on app server 3. Set some acl properties for this file. Using acl provide read + write '(rw)' `permissions to group banner` (i.e entity is banner and etype is group).

> Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure the playbook works this way, without passing any extra arguments.

## Steps

0. Move into Ansible directory

    ```sh
    cd ansible
    ls
    ```

1. Check inventory file:

    ```sh
    cat inventory
    ```

2. Create an empty playbook.yml file

    ```sh
    touch playbook.yml
    ```

3. Update `playbook.yml` file with copy-paste contents from this [YAML file](../files/ansible_playbook_acl_users_090.yml)

4. Run the playbook command:

    ```sh
    ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
    ```

## Good to Know?

### Access Control Lists (ACLs)

- **ACLs** extend traditional Unix permissions beyond owner/group/other
- Allow fine-grained permissions for specific users and groups
- **Entity Types**: `user`, `group`, `mask`, `other`
- **Permissions**: `r` (read), `w` (write), `x` (execute)

### Ansible ACL Module

- **Module**: `ansible.posix.acl` - manages file/directory ACLs
- **Key Parameters**:
  - `path`: Target file/directory path
  - `entity`: User/group name for ACL entry
  - `etype`: Entity type (`user`, `group`, `mask`, `other`)
  - `permissions`: Permission string (`r`, `w`, `x`, `rw`, `rwx`)
  - `state`: `present` (default) or `absent`

### ACL Commands

- **View ACLs**: `getfacl filename`
- **Set ACLs**: `setfacl -m u:user:rw filename`
- **Remove ACLs**: `setfacl -x u:user filename`

### Best Practices

- Always specify `etype` and `entity` for clarity
- Use minimal permissions required
- Test ACL changes before production deployment
- Document ACL requirements in playbook comments
